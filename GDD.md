### Story ###
Max is eight years old and loves to go to the park and play with lots of toys. The only problem is he likes to take other kids toys and play with them and not share. He has a blast doing this and neither of his parents seem to notice to correct him. All the other kids tell their parents what is going on but Max's parents continue to defend their son and say "Max would never do that."

One hot July day Max went to the park and stole a little boy's bouncy ball and wouldn't let that little boy play with it with him. Little did Max know that the little boy was really a powerful wizard from the times where wars were fought with swords and there was no running water or bathrooms. The wizard was not happy with Max and turned him into a bouncy ball and put him in a different realm.

In order for Max to return to normal and come back to the realm earth is in he must bounce through the realm and collect the toys he took from others in order to return them to there rightful owners.

## Power-ups and Score ##

---

### Power-ups ###
  * Super-Sonic Bounce Ball - this is a use if you need it power-up. Once the player decides to use it they complete the level but may not be able to get a certain score.
  * Super Bounce - this give the player the ability to bounce twice as high as normal and not be harmed by any enemies or obstacles.
  * Flame Ball - this gives the player the element of fire and melts ice obstacles and burns wood.
  * Ice Ball - this gives the player the element of ice and can be used to freeze water and enemies.
  * Water Ball - this gives the player the element of water and gives them the ability to put out fires and fire enemies.
  * Lightning Ball - this gives the player the element of lightning and gives the ability to power devices or destroy robots.

### Score ###
Score will be determined by three factors: how much time it took to complete a level, how many objects were collected(power-ups, jacks, etc.), and whether the Super-Sonic Bounce Ball was used.

Time will act as a score multiplier and will be where the player gets of their points. The score bonus will be determined by the percentage of time left before the player would have taken 2 minutes.  The formula looks like this:

(((time taken / 2 min) x 100) - 100) / -10 = score multiplier

For Example:

(((1.2 min / 2.0 min) x 100) - 100) / -10 = 4x multiplier

No score for time will be given if the player takes more than 2 minutes to complete a level.

jacks will only raise the score 10 points and power-ups will raise it 100. Jacks will also give you an extra life after collecting 100.
